        <h1> <center> Welcome to Raf's Programming Portfolio </center> </h1>
 
<p> <center> This webpage has a collection of programs that I wrote in CSC 106 class at the University of Rhode Island.<br> Here you will see my projects throughout the 2021 Fall semester and maybe on for the rest of my college career!<br> It is empty as of now but it will surely fill up during the semester! <br> 
    Feel free to learn more about me in the About Me tab!<br> And also take a look at my creations with Javascript by clicking on the <a href="https://rmendez2003.github.io/Javascript.html" Javascript tab </a>. </center> </p>
