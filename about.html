        <h2> Academics </h2>
        <p> I am a freshman at URI, graduated from Classical High School. <br> My major is Computer Science, but I am also minoring in cyber security so that I can get into the graduate program for cybersecurity. <br> Computer Science was something I knew I wanted to study when i took my highschool CSC class and I found out how powerful of a tool it is. <br> I believe that programing is the new reading and writing. Everyone should know it.</p>
