        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p> I am a freshman at URI, graduated from Classical High School, in Providence, Rhode Island. <br> My major is Computer Science, but I am also minoring in cyber security so that I can get into the graduate program for cybersecurity. <br> Computer Science was something I knew I wanted to study when I took my highschool CSC class and I found out how powerful of a tool it is. <br> I believe that programing is the new reading and writing. Everyone should know it.</p> 
           I am a really social person and I like to be around people alot.<br>
           I like to go fishing on my free time, here you can see a picture of one of the biggest bass  have caught.<br>
           I also like to try new foods alot because I get bored of eating the same thing over and over.<br>
           And I also just like hanging arond and relaxing.<br>
